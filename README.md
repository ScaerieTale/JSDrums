#JSDrums!
## These completely functional virtual drums let you rock out at your keyboard!*
### *I haven't been able to test on mobile devices to see if click is parsed as a touchscreen event yet.
Just head over to https://scaerieTale.github.io/JSDrums to get started!

## INSTRUCTIONS
WASD to control the four toms, j for snare, k for kick-bass, and l for crash cymbal.  This project was a part of London App Brewery's 2022 Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy, so, as of writing this readme, the HTML and CSS were done by the App Brewery crew, while I provided the JavaScript.

Eventually I'll come back and revisit this project to add a hi-hat and ride cymbals.  I'd love to make the keyboard controls customizable, too.
